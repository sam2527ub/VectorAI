# Multi-Agent AI System

## Project Overview

This project builds an **interactive multi-agent AI system** where different persona-driven agents, each with their own knowledge boundaries, **communicate and collaborate** to solve complex problems.

Instead of relying on a single AI, the system allows multiple agents to:
- Share evidence
- Challenge each other's assumptions
- Build on each other's ideas
- Reach conclusions no single agent could achieve alone

The user can **observe, steer, or directly talk** to individual agents, while the system ensures realistic expert teamwork, transparent reasoning, and actionable solutions.

Personas are **not pre-defined**. They are discovered automatically from the **Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus** using unsupervised analysis of style and semantic features. Each persona becomes an independent agent with:
- Its own prompting frame
- Specialized knowledge boundary
- Independent retrieval index

We use **LangGraph** to orchestrate agent communication, define how findings and citations are shared, and enforce strict **knowledge isolation** at the node level.

---

## Solution Approach

I designed a **multi-agent collaborative framework** with LangGraph that simulates a **therapeutic consultation team**.

### Key Features

- **Smart Collaboration**: Detects when multiple agents are needed vs. when a single agent can reply
- **Agent Discussions**: Agents talk to each other, debate, and refine ideas before answering the user
- **Distinct Personas**: Each agent keeps its own style and domain expertise
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Responses include citations and source inspirations from movie dialogues
- **Context Retention**: Agents remember what has been discussed across multiple turns
- **User Choice**: The system can auto-select the best agent, or the user can choose directly
- **Explainability**: Agents can explain why they reached a conclusion
- **Extensible Design**: New personas or datasets can be added easily---

## Persona Discovery  
**Data Source**: Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus (220,579 conversational exchanges)  

### Pipeline Used  
- TF-IDF vectorization (stylistic features)  
- Sentiment analysis (emotional tone)  
- Topic modeling (semantic themes)  
- Semantic embedding analysis (deeper meaning)  
- K-Means clustering (grouping personas)  

### Results  
From clustering, 4 behavioral personas appeared:  
1. Authority Figures & Command Leaders  
2. Raw & Aggressive Speakers  
3. Emotional & Caring Characters  
4. Polite & Helpful Speakers  

### Refinement into 3 Therapeutic Personas  
1. **Optimistic Therapist**  
   - Emotional support, stress relief, confidence building  
   - 87% similarity with therapeutic communication patterns  

2. **Intelligent Expert**  
   - Practical solutions, planning, systematic analysis  
   - 91% similarity  

3. **Wise Mentor**  
   - Life wisdom, perspective, values clarification  
   - 89% similarity  

---

## Example Scenario  

**User Query**:  
*A mid-sized company is facing high employee burnout and declining productivity. Leadership wants to understand the root causes and find sustainable solutions that balance employee well-being with business performance.*  

### Workflow  

1. **Domain Detection**  
   The system first identifies the domain of the query.  
   ![alt text](domain-1.png)  

2. **Initial Insights**  
   Each agent shares its first observations.  
   ![alt text](insights-1.png)  

3. **Agent Discussions**  
   Agents collaborate, build on each other’s knowledge, and refine their solutions.  
   ![alt text](r1_1.png)  
   ![alt text](r2_1.png)  

4. **Unified Solutions**  
   Each agent then gives its final answer based on its expertise, with reasoning and citations.  
   - Therapist focuses on emotional well-being.  
   - Expert suggests structural improvements.  
   - Mentor provides long-term cultural guidance.  
   ![alt text](therapist-1.png)  

5. **Dynamic Conversation**  
   Agents also **ask each other questions** to clarify ideas while responding to the user.  
   ![alt text](expert_1.png)  
   ![alt text](expert_2.png)  

6. **Single Agent Case**  
   If the query falls only under one domain, the relevant agent answers directly. But user can always choose the desired agent.
   ![alt text](single_agent.png)  

7. **Follow-Up Questions**  
   For follow-ups, agents respond with **full context remembered**.  
   ![alt text](follow_up.png)  

---

## Key Benefits  
- **Realistic teamwork**: Agents collaborate like an expert panel.  
- **Knowledge isolation**: Each agent stays within its boundary.  
- **User control**: User can pick an agent or let the system decide.  
- **Transparent**: Every answer shows reasoning and inspiration source.  
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new personas and external datasets.

## Persona Discovery Process


## Steps in the Process  
1. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**  
2. **Multi-Dimensional Feature Engineering**  
3. **Clustering Pipeline Development**  
4. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**  
5. **Topic Modeling & Semantic Understanding**  
6. **Persona Refinement & Validation**  
7. **Final Therapeutic Persona Selection**  
8. **Technical Implementation Pipeline**  
9. **Saved Models & Artifacts**  

---

## 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline  

I aggregated all dialogues for each character, along with their **movie names, genres, and metadata**.  
There were **9,035 unique characters** in total.  

I designed a **three-tier cleaning approach** to preserve different aspects of the data for specific analysis purposes:  

- **Surface Level Cleaning**  
  - Removes stage directions & excessive noise.  
  - Preserves tone, exclamations, and emotional expressions.  
  - **Purpose**: Sentiment analysis.  

- **Semantic Level Cleaning**  
  - Lemmatization (converts words to base dictionary form) but keeps sentence structure intact.  
  - **Purpose**: Persona identification via TF-IDF vectorization.  

- **Full Cleaning**  
  - Removes stop words, focusing only on content words.  
  - **Purpose**: Topic modeling.  

**What each level captured:**  
- *Surface*: Emotional intensity & communication style.  
- *Semantic*: Behavioral patterns with readability.  
- *Full*: Thematic content without stylistic noise.  

---

## 2. Multi-Dimensional Feature Engineering  

I engineered multiple feature sets to capture **different aspects of communication**:  

- **TF-IDF Features**  
  - Balances common vs. rare words.  
  - Captures meaningful behavioral patterns instead of generic dialogue.  

- **Sentiment Features**  
  - Polarity (positive/negative/neutral)  
  - Subjectivity (objective vs. personal)  
  - Intensity (strength of emotion)  

- **Stylistic Metadata Features**  
  - `exclamation_ratio`: Emotional expressiveness  
  - `question_ratio`: Inquisitive nature  
  - `caps_ratio`: Intensity & emphasis  
  - `profanity_ratio`: Raw/unfiltered communication  
  - `formality_score`: Formal vs. casual tone  
  - `avg_sentence_length`: Verbosity vs. conciseness  
  - `repetition_score`: Speech pattern consistency  

---

## 3. Clustering  

I used **K-Means clustering** to group characters into distinct personas.  
After testing, **K=4** was selected as the best balance between distinctiveness and interpretability.  

![alt text](clustering.png)  

---

## 4. Sentiment Analysis  

By combining clustering with sentiment features, personas became **more interpretable and realistic**.  

![alt text](sentiment.png)  

- **Silhouette Score**: 0.092 (improved from 0.089 with TF-IDF only)  
- **Cluster separation**: Stronger emotional differentiation  
- **Interpretability**: Clearer persona emergence  

### Sentiment-Enhanced Persona Profiles  

| Cluster        | Polarity | Subjectivity | Intensity | Interpretation                          |
|----------------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0 (Authority)  | 0.034    | 0.398        | 0.052     | Neutral, objective, controlled          |
| 1 (Aggressive) | -0.089   | 0.623        | 0.127     | Negative, personal, intense             |
| 2 (Caring)     | 0.187    | 0.678        | 0.078     | Positive, emotional, warm               |
| 3 (Polite)     | 0.156    | 0.534        | 0.065     | Positive, balanced, gentle              |  

---

## 5. Topic Modeling & Semantic Understanding  

I performed **LDA topic modeling** on the fully cleaned data and cross-validated with clusters.  

- **Cluster 0 (Authority)**: High Military/Authority topic scores (avg: 0.247)  
- **Cluster 1 (Aggressive)**: Mix of Crime/Legal & Business topics  
- **Cluster 2 (Caring)**: High Family/Personal topic scores (avg: 0.234)  
- **Cluster 3 (Polite)**: Balanced across Business & Location topics  

---

## 6. Semantic Similarity Analysis  

To ensure personas reflect **real behavioral meaning**, I used **SentenceTransformer embeddings** to compute similarity.  

- Threshold: **> 0.3 semantic similarity**  
- Results:  
  - **Optimistic Therapist** → 847 candidates (max: 0.524)  
  - **Wise Mentor** → 692 candidates (max: 0.498)

# Collaboration Architecture
This system is built around a **multi-agent collaboration model** inspired by real human consultations.  
Think of it as **three specialists in a room, discussing a case together**:  

- **Therapist** → Focuses on emotional well-being, anxiety, and confidence.  
- **Expert** → Provides practical solutions, structured steps, and problem-solving strategies.  
- **Wise Mentor** → Offers perspective, meaning, and big-picture guidance.  

Together, they create **solutions** that go beyond what a single agent could provide.
