'll tell her but she wo n't take it . do n't buy it and neither will jury . suspicion maybe but suspicion be n't enough for conviction . why would she want that ? think about it . if she be go to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find ? you 're bluffing . john , it me , remember ? 've know you since your name be juan carlos . can you ? you ca n't show intent . lookin to make the paper , john ? no . miss lawson come in here voluntarily to answer your question . she do n't have to sit here and be insult . so , either you charge her now or we 're leave . that it . my client do n't have to take this crap from you . mean she only screw me two or three time night because she have to 'm sure she do n't enjoy it . 'm sure that every orgasm she have with me be fake . do n't you see what she do ? she need you to kill me . she plan it that way from the start . that why she phone me tonight . that all paley . no far question . suggest it never happen . you 're still angry , be n't you ? be n't it true that your whole story be nothing more than vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson ? you 'll be sorry ? and after that do n't you continuously harass miss lawson ? and the argument be about the fact that you want to be romantically involve and she do not . if necessary can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customer who witness the occurrence . you do n't grab her and try to kiss her ? be n't it true that later that night you try to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot ? paley , where be you the last time you saw miss lawson ? then you have no way of know what marsh told miss lawson be the reason for his visit ? do miss lawson ever accompany marsh inside during his examination ? do marsh ever tell you that he have spoken to miss lawson about his illness ? trammel , do you ever speak to miss lawson about marsh condition ? one last question , doctor . if someone do n't know well , would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine ? previous witness state that she saw miss lawson pour white powder into her hand on october . accord to your record when do you prescribe the drug ? how do you instruct your patient to take it ? would you describe for the court what chinese peony root look like ? what do you prescribe for her ? do you ever prescribe any medication for her cramp ? why do she come to you ? and be miss lawson patient of yours ? wong what type of medicine do you practice ? what else do the district attorney office tell you to say ? then those be not your own word ? high school ? do you go to college , crawford ? what happen ? what happen next ? do you remember his exact word ? what do he say ? how ? do he make your life miserable ? and what do paley do after you stop see him ? then what happen ? what be the nature of your relationship with paley . where do you meet him ? miss seller , do you know alan paley ? then why do you go see koehler in the first place ? you do n't know about it before that ? why 'd you come here ? what do you have in your purse ? you kill him do n't you , joanne ? then you would have gotten your money ? because you be jealous . because he cut you out of the will . because you have cocaine habit to feed because you know that if rebecca lawson be found guilty the new will be void and there very good chance the old one would be honor . be n't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle ? be n't it true that you stop by the house after you left the drug store and drop off the item you bought ? you see that what bother me . no other bottle of nasal spray be found in the house . the police look . there be only the one bottle . but you say you do n't arrive until after marsh be dead yet we know he be use the nasal spray prior to his death . how do you think it get there ? or ? would you read for u the time of the purchase ? there an item you picked up that marked . will you read it ? well 'm little confuse . this be charge receipt from rosen drug store where marsh have an account . it date the day of the murder . be this your signature ? two hundred and fifty thousand dollar be lot of money . that must have make you pretty angry ? in his previous will marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollar then he cut you out . why do you think he do that ? and that he change his will ? and that marsh paid less attention to you ? and you resent that he care for her in way he once care for you ? you resent the fact that she told you what to do in marsh house ? you do n't like her because you be involve with marsh before she come along . be n't that true ? you do n't like miss lawson much do you ? you 've try it ? be n't it true that you 've be in and out of rehab center for the last four year ? money be n't the only reason people commit murder , miss braslow . it must have be horrible . have to go there see them together know he be sleep with her in the same bed he do with you . you 're lie . marsh be wear cast on the tape . it be right before he go to chicago and met miss lawson . he dumped you for her , do n't he ? thought he be kind , gentle man ? he video taped you . well , think about it . be n't it possible ? so , be n't it possible that he be confide in you about the pain he be feel about lose what might be his last chance for love ? that what he really be say be that the uncertainty of her leave be drive him crazy and if it do n't stop it be go to kill him . that if she do leave his heart could n't take it . so , the woman he love passionately be think about leave . that must cause tremendous anxiety . sleepless night . incredible stress . do n't marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bore here and be think about go back to chicago for awhile ? could you repeat the last part of what marsh say to you the day before his death ? do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom ? how do you know it be cocaine that miss lawson have in the bathroom ? how do you know that ? what about miss lawson ? do marsh use drug ? how do you know what kind of sex they have ? if you do n't know her that well what make you think she capable of murder ? take it you do n't like miss lawson very much ? you do n't really believe what the district attorney be say about miss lawson , do you ? what change ? 'm not ask for name or specific . just want to know what prompt you to make the call ? need to ask you question . what make you get in touch with joanne braslow ? hi , joe . no far question . would it be fair to say that when she do find out it be shock to her ? and she left shortly after that ? and do n't miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover ? and your sexual taste be something that you hid from miss lawson ? how it suppose to work rebecca ? you and paley celebrate your victory . you get me over here and provoke fight so he have to rush in and save you but then he give himself away a your accomplice now he have to kill me . after that figure she 'll tell the police that you broke in . that you be craze because we humiliate you in court ? she right , paley . you 've get to kill me . she do n't have to she free she ca n't be try again but you , you plan it with her . you supply the coke . you 're an accessory to murder . 'm not leave without that tape . that be n't the deal . you kill him . you kill him and get you off . hello ? you 're monster .
